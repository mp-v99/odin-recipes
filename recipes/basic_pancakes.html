    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fluffy, golden pancakes that are easy to make and perfect for breakfast or brunch. This simple recipe yields soft and airy pancakes, ideal for stacking high and drizzling with syrup or your favorite toppings.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100g plain flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>300ml/½ pint semi-skimmed milk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable or sunflower oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, milk, and melted butter (or oil) until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the pan:</strong> Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or cooking spray.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the pancakes:</strong> Pour a small amount of batter onto the skillet to form pancakes (about 1/4 cup per pancake). Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Stack the pancakes on a plate and serve with your favorite toppings, like syrup, butter, or fresh fruit.</li>
    </ol>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F)</strong> and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                <li><strong>Mix the ingredients:</strong> In a bowl, combine the peanut butter, sugar, and salt. Stir well until fully blended.</li>
                <li><strong>Add the egg:</strong> Crack the egg into the mixture and mix until smooth and well combined.</li>
                <li><strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of dough and roll them into balls. Place them onto the baking sheet, leaving space between each.</li>
                <li><strong>Flatten the cookies:</strong> Using a fork, gently press down on each cookie to create a crisscross pattern.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the cookies in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes or until they are golden brown around the edges.</li>
                <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
